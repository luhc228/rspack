  help: Found the module '../a.txt' exists, but it was not resolved because its extension doesn't in the `resolve.extensions` list. Here are some possible solutions:
        
        1. add the extension '.txt' to `resolve.extensions` in your rspack configuration
        2. use '../a.txt' instead of '../a'
        3. add the file path '../a.txt' to the `entry` in your rspack configuration
