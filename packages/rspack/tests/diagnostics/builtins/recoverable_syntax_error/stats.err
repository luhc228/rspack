ERROR in Ã— Resolve error: Can't resolve './' in '<PROJECT_ROOT>/tests/diagnostics/builtins/recoverable_syntax_error'
  help: Found the module './index.tsx' exists, but it was not resolved because its extension doesn't in the `resolve.extensions` list. Here are some possible solutions:
        
        1. add the extension '.tsx' to `resolve.extensions` in your rspack configuration
        2. use './index.tsx' instead of './'
        3. add the file path './index.tsx' to the `entry` in your rspack configuration
